## What does the model do?

This is a simple model trained to classify 46 different models in Mercedes-Benz car. Model is pretrained in Kaggle.

Dataset is included in this repo, but I have created a dataset in Kaggle. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benlaw/mercedes-models-v2">Check dataset here</a>

## Example of Use:
<br>
<img src="Projects/mercedes-model-classifier\output-example1.png" alt="example1 for model usage" width=80% height=80%>
<br>
<i>Figure 1 output-example1.png</i>

<br>

<img src="Projects/mercedes-model-classifier\output-example2.png" alt="example2 for model usage" width=80% height=80%>
<br>
<i>Figure 2 output-example2.png</i>
<br>
The image on the left is our input; the image on the right is one of the model image for the model's predicted output.

For example, in <i>Figure 1</i> we inputed a <b>g-class model</b> image, and the model predicted the image as an <b>amg-cls model</b>.

<br>

The output in this model is not ideal enough, but it is a simple trial to verify my AI self-learning process.
